# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing memory usage in the CRSP (Cognition via Rewarded Self-Play) framework to resolve CUDA out of memory errors during training. The optimization focuses on reducing GPU memory consumption while maintaining the theoretical foundations and performance characteristics described in CRSP.tex.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory-Efficient Gradient Computation

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want optimized gradient computation that reduces memory footprint, so that training can proceed without CUDA out of memory errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing TR-RPG gradients THEN the system SHALL use gradient accumulation to reduce batch memory requirements
2. WHEN processing importance weights THEN the system SHALL compute them in chunks to avoid large tensor allocations
3. WHEN calculating KL regularization terms THEN the system SHALL use in-place operations where possible
4. WHEN handling policy-specific gradients THEN the system SHALL process policies sequentially rather than simultaneously
5. WHEN accumulating gradients THEN the system SHALL clear intermediate tensors immediately after use

### Requirement 2: Optimized Reward Computation

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want memory-efficient reward computation that maintains CRSP's multi-dimensional reward structure, so that the system can handle larger batch sizes without memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing length rewards THEN the system SHALL process samples in mini-batches rather than full batches
2. WHEN evaluating creativity scores THEN the system SHALL use streaming processing for large batches
3. WHEN normalizing rewards THEN the system SHALL use running statistics instead of storing full reward histories
4. WHEN computing alpha decay schedules THEN the system SHALL cache computed values to avoid redundant calculations
5. WHEN integrating multi-dimensional rewards THEN the system SHALL minimize temporary tensor allocations

### Requirement 3: Efficient Data Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized data loading and processing that reduces memory overhead, so that the system can handle larger datasets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading training data THEN the system SHALL use streaming data loaders with configurable buffer sizes
2. WHEN processing critique evaluations THEN the system SHALL batch process samples efficiently
3. WHEN handling trajectory seeding THEN the system SHALL use memory-mapped file access for large datasets
4. WHEN tokenizing inputs THEN the system SHALL use dynamic padding instead of fixed-length padding
5. WHEN caching processed data THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache with memory limits

### Requirement 4: Model Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want optimized model memory usage that leverages existing FSDP and gradient checkpointing, so that larger models can be trained within memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using FSDP THEN the system SHALL optimize parameter sharding for the three-policy architecture
2. WHEN applying gradient checkpointing THEN the system SHALL selectively checkpoint only memory-intensive layers
3. WHEN storing reference policies THEN the system SHALL use parameter sharing where possible
4. WHEN updating policy parameters THEN the system SHALL use in-place updates to minimize memory copies
5. WHEN handling multiple policy roles THEN the system SHALL optimize memory layout for sequential processing

### Requirement 5: Batch Size and Sequence Length Optimization

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want adaptive batch sizing and sequence length management, so that training can automatically adjust to available memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining batch sizes THEN the system SHALL implement dynamic batch sizing based on available memory
2. WHEN processing variable-length sequences THEN the system SHALL use efficient packing strategies
3. WHEN handling long reasoning chains THEN the system SHALL implement sequence truncation with gradient accumulation
4. WHEN managing memory pressure THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce batch sizes with warning logs
5. WHEN optimizing throughput THEN the system SHALL balance batch size and gradient accumulation steps

### Requirement 6: Memory Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive memory monitoring and debugging tools, so that memory issues can be identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL log initial memory usage and available capacity
2. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL provide detailed memory allocation tracking
3. WHEN approaching memory limits THEN the system SHALL issue warnings before out-of-memory errors
4. WHEN debugging memory issues THEN the system SHALL provide tensor allocation summaries
5. WHEN optimizing memory THEN the system SHALL log memory savings achieved by optimizations

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Fallback Strategies

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable memory optimization settings with automatic fallback strategies, so that training can adapt to different hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring memory settings THEN the system SHALL provide tunable parameters for all optimization strategies
2. WHEN memory optimization fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to more conservative settings
3. WHEN running on different hardware THEN the system SHALL auto-detect optimal memory configuration
4. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies
5. WHEN optimizations are disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with original implementation
